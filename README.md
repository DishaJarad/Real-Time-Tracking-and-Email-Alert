# Real-Time-Tracking-and-Email-Alert
📝 Project Overview

This project implements a real-time location tracking and automated email alert system using Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap (OSM). The application fetches the user’s live GPS coordinates, displays their current position on an interactive map, and generates an optimized route from the user’s location to the destination. Additionally, the system triggers an automatic email alert when the user comes within 200 meters of the destination.

🚀 Key Features

*Real-Time Location Tracking:
Fetches and updates the user’s live GPS coordinates using browser geolocation services.

*Interactive Map Visualization:
Displays the user's location on a dynamic Leaflet + OSM map with smooth marker updates.

*Optimized Route Generation:
Plots an efficient route from the user's current location to a predefined destination.

*Proximity-Based Email Alerts:
Automatically sends an email to the user when they enter a 200-meter radius of the destination.

*Responsive and Lightweight UI:
Ensures seamless real-time map rendering and user experience.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Leaflet.js – map rendering and interaction
OpenStreetMap (OSM) – maps and routing
HTML, CSS, JavaScript – frontend
Geolocation API – live GPS data
Email API (Sendinblue ) – for automated alerts


📌 How It Works

1)User enables GPS/location access in the browser.

2)Application retrieves current coordinates and plots them on the Leaflet map.

3)The system calculates and displays the optimized route to the destination.

4)Distance to the destination is monitored continuously.

5)If the user is within 200 meters, an automated email alert is triggered.
